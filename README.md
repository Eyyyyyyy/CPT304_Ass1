General instruction
Objective: The main aim of this project is to provide hands-on experience with design patterns. Students should be able to identify correct situations for different design patterns and implement them in a console-based application.
Task: Each group of 4 is to create a simple console-based Library Management System which must incorporate at least three design patterns: one Creational, one Structural, and one Behavioural.
• Creational could be Singleton, Factory Method, or Builder。
• Structural could be Adapter, Decorator, or Proxy.
• Behavioural could be Observer, Strategy, or Command
Requirements:
1. The application should be able to handle book add/remove operations, user registrations,
and checking books in and out.
2. Utilize the Singleton pattern to handle a database connection object, which in this case
could be a simple file or in-memory database.
3. Choose a use case for Factory Method or Builder pattern: Factory Method pattern can be
used to create different types of books or users.
4. For structural patterns, you might use the Decorator pattern to dynamically assign fines to
overdue books.
5. Use a behavioural pattern to handle some part of the application logic. For example, the
Strategy pattern could be used to switch between different search mechanisms for books, or the Observer pattern can notify users when a book they want becomes available.
